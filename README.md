# Team Profile Generator

**Note**: My instructor provided the class with starter code to assist in coding this week's homework assignment. The starter code can be found in the first commit of this repository.

For this week's challenge, I built a team profile generator using my knowledge of Object-oriented programming (OOP), Test-driven development (TDD), Jest, and Inquirer. This application allows a user to create a software engineering team profile by answering prompts from the command line. Once the prompts are completed, the application will then take the user input and generate an HTML file that displays the employees' information such as names, ids, and email addresses. This application tested us on our understanding of OOP, including classes, properties, methods, constructors, and inheritance, as well as the concept of TDD and how Jest plays a role in software development. In addition, this application allowed us to utilize Inquirer to take in user input and generate objects based on the information provided.

## Installation

To install this application:
- Clone the application's repository and place it into a local directory on your computer.
- Ensure that your computer has node.js installed. Typing'node -v' into the terminal will display the current version installed.
- Open a command-line terminal (VS Code, Git Bash, etc.) and navigate to the directory containing the application's 'index.js'.
- In the command-line, type 'npm install' to download the application's dependencies.

## Usage

To use this application:
- When your command-line terminal is in the repository's root directory, type 'node index.js' into the command-line to start the application.
- Answer each prompt that displays in the terminal. Note that the prompts require an input before proceeding to the next question.
- When all prompts are answered, a message will inform the user that the HTML file has been created.
- Navigate to the 'dist' directory to find your completed 'team.html'.
